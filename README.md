## Project Description 

This project is a modern portfolio and gallery website for a fictional artist, built using **Laravel**, **React**, and **Inertia.js**. It provides a platform for the artist to showcase their work, share blog posts, and list their pieces with prices. This is not an e-commerce project; the "Shop" section is designed for displaying and filtering artworks without a shopping cart or payment system.

> **Note:** The design of this site was created by referencing and modifying a paid template found online.
